	abstract = {The inclusive top quark pair (\$t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\$) production cross-section \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\}\$ has been measured in proton\$-\$proton collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=13\$ {TeV}, using \$36.1\$ fb\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ of data collected in 2015\$-\$16 by the {ATLAS} experiment at the {LHC}. Using events with an opposite-charge \$e{\textbackslash}mu\$ pair and \$b\$-tagged jets, the cross-section is measured to be: {\textbackslash}begin\{equation\}{\textbackslash}nonumber {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\} = 826.4 {\textbackslash}pm 3.6{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(stat)\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}pm 11.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(syst)\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}pm 15.7{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(lumi)\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}pm 1.9{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(beam)\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pb\}, {\textbackslash}end\{equation\} where the uncertainties reflect the limited size of the data sample, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, the integrated luminosity, and the {LHC} beam energy, giving a total uncertainty of 2.4\%. The result is consistent with theoretical {QCD} calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. It is used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the predicted cross-section on \$m\_t{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pole\}\}\$, giving \$m\_t{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pole\}\}=173.1{\textasciicircum}\{+2.0\}\_\{-2.1\}\$ {GeV}. It is also combined with measurements at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=7\$ {TeV} and \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=8\$ {TeV} to derive ratios and double ratios of \$t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\$ and \$Z\$ cross-sections at different energies. The same event sample is used to measure absolute and normalised differential cross-sections as functions of single-lepton and dilepton kinematic variables, and the results compared with predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators.},

We describe the principal features of the Ariadne, Herwig++, Pythia 8 and Sherpa generators, together with the Rivet and Professor validation and tuning tools, and discuss the physics philosophy behind the proper use of these generators and tools. This review is aimed at phenomenologists wishing to understand better how parton-level predictions are translated into hadron-level events as well as experimentalists wanting a deeper insight into the tools available for signal and background simulation at the {LHC}.},

	abstract = {Single- and double-differential cross-section measurements are presented for the production of top-quark pairs, in the lepton + jets channel at particle and parton level. Two topologies, resolved and boosted, are considered and the results are presented as a function of several kinematic variables characterising the top and \$t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\$ system and jet multiplicities. The study was performed using data from \$pp\$ collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 {TeV} collected in 2015 and 2016 by the {ATLAS} detector at the {CERN} Large Hadron Collider ({LHC}), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \$36{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{fb\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Due to the large \$t{\textbackslash}bar\{t\}\$ cross-section at the {LHC}, such measurements allow a detailed study of the properties of top-quark production and decay, enabling precision tests of several Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order Standard Model predictions. Overall, there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the data.},

	abstract = {One- and two-jet inclusive quantities in hadron collisions have already been calculated to next-to-leading order accuracy, using both the subtraction and the cone method. Since the one-loop corrections have recently been obtained for all five-parton amplitudes, three-jet inclusive quantities can also be predicted to next-to-leading order. The subtraction method presented in the literature is based on a systematic use of boost-invariant kinematical variables, and therefore its application to three-jet production is quite cumbersome. In this paper we re-analyze the subtraction method and point out the advantage of using angle and energy variables. This leads to simpler results and it has complete generality, extending its validity to \$n\$-jet production. The formalism is also applicable to \$n\$-jet production in \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$ annihilation and in photon-hadron collisions. All the analytical results necessary to construct an efficient numerical program for next-to-leading order three-jet inclusive quantities in hadroproduction are given explicitly. As new analytical result, we also report the collinear limits of all the two-to-four processes.},
